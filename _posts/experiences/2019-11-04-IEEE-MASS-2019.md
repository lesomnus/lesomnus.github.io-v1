The serverless platforms offer orchestration tool that supports composing workflow with the serverless functions on their platform. This orchestration tool creates an independent function that invokes other serverless functions step by step. However, since the existing serverless platform does not consider an execution of the workflow, the messages between functions are delivered inefficiently. We implemented a layered message bus to improve message delivery latency when executing workflow in a serverless environment. Our implementation shows 205.37x and 56.12x improvement at the best and the worst case respectively, compared to OpenWhisk Composer.
