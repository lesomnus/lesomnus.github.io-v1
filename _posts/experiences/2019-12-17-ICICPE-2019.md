Most of the serverless service providers assume that the task is stateless for scalability reasons. Therefore, if there is a data dependency between the activities when executing workflow in the serverless environment, the data must be transferred through the external storage to the next activity. In this paper, we propose a system that can reduce the number of external storage accesses by using the storage of the host considering the workflow execution in the serverless environment and describes the implementation of the system.
