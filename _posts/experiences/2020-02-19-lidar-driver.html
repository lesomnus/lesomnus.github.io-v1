<p>
    Drivers officially provided by lidar manufacturers already exist, but they need to be implemented by ourselves for
    performance reasons or to add custom features. In particular, in the case of the latter, if the feature is
    integrated in the parsing process, it can be implemented at zero-cost. In addition, since the specifications of raw
    data are different for each lidar model, the maintenance cost incurred when adding support for a new model was also
    high.

<p>
    I generalized the interface to access lidar data and matched the unique pattern of the input data to the
    pre-specified model, updating only the library version and implementing it so that no changes to the existing code
    were required. In addition, it minimizes the cost of dynamic allocation by using the packet memory space allocated
    from the network stack as it is, and writes the code in a way that is advantageous for fast memory access and uses
    SIMD instructions, resulting in 3 times faster than the official driver.
