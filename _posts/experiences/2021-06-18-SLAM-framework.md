In a project to create high-definition maps based on lidar and positioning data, I implemented a framework that schedules multiple modules running in parallel to create maps and provides convenient APIs to access the data (lidar or pose information) with integrity.

*Please note that I have not implemented any SLAM algorithms related to cartography in this project.*
