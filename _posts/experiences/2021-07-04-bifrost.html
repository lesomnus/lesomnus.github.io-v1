	This project was developed in private time and contributed to the company in order to efficiently manage the
	increasing demand for interviews at work. It implements two <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr>, one
	for the interviewer and one for the interviewee, and includes a mailing feature to notify to the participant that
	the interview has started, ended, or a deadline is approaching. The interviewer can submit the code and check the
	execution result and whether or not the answer is correct in real time.

<p>
	The server process does not store local information and implements all functions to depend on the atomic operation
	of the DB and message queue to prevent duplication of work and build a scalable system. In other words, the API
	server and the agent server that runs the user code can scale-out as much as the scalability guaranteed by the DB.
	In addition, in order to prevent security issues and server resource exhaustion caused by the execution of
	user-submitted code, a container is created to execute user code at the moment a user request occurs and the user
	code is executed in it. This allows applications to be deployed in the cloud, throttling server resources as needed.
