In a project related to calibration, I designed a pipeline that properly processes and delivers data generated in real time to the algorithm execution stage. In addition, an integrated interface was designed by abstracting the sensor device used in the algorithm at the code level, and through this, a feature to determine whether the sensor required for the program is operating was implemented.

*Please note that I have not implemented any calibration algorithms related to this project.*
