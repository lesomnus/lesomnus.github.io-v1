<p>
	This project was developed in private time as a need to automate the maintenance of the latest version of various
	development environments at work. With information about which base images it depends on, CLade builds a dependency tree. Starting from the base image of the root node, if the latest tag is found in the remote registry or if the layer has been changed in the existing tag, it helps to build the child image.
