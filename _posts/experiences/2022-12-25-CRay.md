CRay creates a schema for your data by tracking how you access it. You don't have to keep checking each value in the middle of your code to see if it satisfies the condition you want. Validate documents at once with an automatically generated schema, and see at a glance what values went wrong.

This project was started to show off my understanding of the C++ programming language and interest in the modern C++ standards. The provided API utilizes templates to help users avoid writing invalid code.
